### Continued development

I am currently learning about responsive design and accessibility. I plan to focus on improving my understanding of CSS Grid and implementing more accessible design patterns. I also want to explore the use of JavaScript for interactive elements and improve my knowledge of accessibility APIs. I am also interested in learning more about server-side rendering and improving my understanding of performance optimization.
